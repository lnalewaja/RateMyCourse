-- Notes:
-- Be sure to replace 'hashed_passwordX' with actual hashed passwords if storing real user data.
-- The course_id and user_id values in the Reviews table are referring to the IDs generated when rows are inserted into the Users and Courses tables respectively.
-- Ensure that foreign key relations are properly maintained, meaning the user_ids and course_ids in the Reviews table should exist in the Users and Courses tables respectively.
